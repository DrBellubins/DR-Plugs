The analysis of the impulse responses reveals that the diffusion amount parameter in the Deelay plugin primarily modulates the scattering intensity and temporal spread of reflections within a feedback delay network (FDN)-like structure, likely implemented through a series of allpass filters or a comparable diffusion mechanism inserted in the signal path. This results in a progressive blending of discrete delay echoes into denser, reverb-like clusters. At low diffusion amounts (e.g., 0 to 0.25), the response exhibits sharp, isolated taps with minimal spread (cluster width approximately 0.001-0.002 seconds before and after the peak). As the amount increases (e.g., to 0.75 or 1.0), the cluster widens significantly (up to 0.03-0.05 seconds total, with pre-peak spread reaching 0.03 seconds at amount 1.0), creating a build-up of reflection density leading into the nominal tap, followed by a decay. This widening occurs symmetrically but with a slight bias toward post-peak extension at intermediate amounts, consistent with the allpass chain's tendency to accumulate density over time.

The "swelling" effect—where reverb reflections appear to build in density and energy approaching the nominal delay tap (around 1 second)—is achieved by dynamically offsetting the internal delay line to accommodate the increasing diffuser spread. Specifically, the main delay length is reduced by an amount proportional to half the diffusion-induced cluster width (estimated 10-150 milliseconds based on observed spreads and documentation). This adjustment positions the early, sparser reflections (low-amplitude initial outputs from the diffuser chain) before the nominal tap time, allowing density to rise progressively toward the peak. The diffuser's impulse response, characterized by increasing reflection count and phase scattering (tap density rising from ~5 at low amounts to 15-50 at high), contributes the rising envelope, as early terms are weaker and sparser while later terms densify through recursive interactions. Damping (likely a lowpass filter in the feedback path) ensures uniform decay after the peak, with high-frequency attenuation accelerating (e.g., -95 to -105 dB in upper bands) to maintain natural tail behavior without abrupt cutoffs.

When the diffusion amount is decreased, the spread contracts, effectively "pinching" the reverb cluster toward the nominal tap from both temporal directions: the pre-tap build-up shortens (reducing the swell), and the post-tap tail compresses, collapsing the response into a more discrete echo. This symmetry arises from the centered adjustment of the delay line, ensuring the peak remains near the user-set nominal time (observed variations of 0.99-1.08 seconds likely stem from sample rate assumptions or envelope shaping). The delay line feeds the diffusion stage, but the offset compensates for the diffuser's causal nature, preventing all energy from appearing after the tap. At full amount (1.0), the structure resembles a reverb-dominant FDN with embedded delay, while lower values bypass or attenuate diffuser stages for cleaner repeats. Quality (set to 8 here) refines this by reducing artifacts in the build-up, and size (fixed at 1) caps the maximum spread, but amount governs the blending progression.
